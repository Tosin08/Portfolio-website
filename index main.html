                    <p>
                        Hi there! I’m Tosin, a creative from Lagos, Nigeria the largest populous of blacks on the African continent, soaking up the Lagos sun and working as a UI/UX Designer with <span class="company_name"> Instincthub
                        </span>team.
                        Prior to my UX journey, I was working as a fitness instructor.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Early 2020, I made a conscious decision to choose a career path that I considered more consequential & fulfilling and after careful deliberation's, I decided to get into the tech space.
                        Initially, I started learning the basics of web development, but got overwhelmed by Javascript, which made me run away. but after about a year i started my web development learning journey again, which is used for this portfolio.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I started out as a self taught designer, learning from online articles & YouTube videos, but I later enrolled for Google's User experience specialization program on Cousera.
                        This Pursuit has strengthened my understanding of core user experience topics such as Ux research fundamentals & ethics, Competitive analysis, Fundamentals of design sprints, Inclusive design, Next billion users, Wireframes & High-fidelity prototypes.
                        
                        I have come to view design, as a problem solving activity, which requires a deep understanding of human behavior & psychology and has a tremendous impact on overall product functionality & experience.
                        My design snapshots are mostly shared on Dribbble and instagram, Music playlists on Audiomack, and i engage in Online Mobile Gaming.
