                        <h4>My Journey</h4>
                        <p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Tosin, a creative from Lagos, Nigeria the largest populous of blacks on the African continent, soaking up the Lagos sun and working as a UI/UX Designer with Instincthub team. 
                            <br>
                        Also, there has always been the existence of a recurring pattern within me, yearning to understand & solve problems around me.Prior to my UX journey, I was working as a fitness instructor.
                        </p>   
                        <p>Early 2020, I made a conscious decision to choose a career path that I considered more consequential & fulfilling and after careful deliberation's, I decided to get into the tech space.
                        <br>
                        Initially, I started learning the basics of web development, but got overwhelmed by Javasript, which made me run away. but after about a year i started my web development learning journey again, which has been a tought but enjoyable journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>I started out as a self taught designer, learning from online articles & YouTube videos, but I later enrolled for Google's User experience specialization program on Cousera. 
                        <br>
                        This Pursuit has strengthened my understanding of core user experience topics such as Ux research fundamentals & ethics, Competitive analysis, Fundamentals of design sprints, Inclusive design, Next billion users, Wireframes & High-fidelity prototypes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I have come to view design, as a problem solving activity, which requires a deep understanding of human behavior & psychology and has a tremendous impact on overall product functionality & experience.
                        <br>
                        My design snapshots are mostly shared on Dribbble and instagram, Music playlists on Spotify, and ocassionally i engage in Mobile Gaming (Call of duty Mobile). 
                        </p>

                            <h2>My work process</h2>

                                    <h3>Research</h3>
                                    <p>You can't solve a problem without understanding your user's need.
                                        Before I start off designing, I ask a lot of questions to understand the problems my clients wants to solve, as well as understanding potential users & their challenges.
                                        This Phase usually involves User research, Competitive analysis, consulting with experts & ideation on possible solutions.</p>

                                    <h3>Design</h3>
                                    <p>Once problems have been defined, I start out designing by creating First-draft designs, which goes from sketches to wireframes, mockups & prototypes.
                                    This process results into designing touchpoints that are intuitive for the users & good for the business.</p>
